    # RUSTSEC-2024-0429: Unsoundness in glib::VariantStrIter (patched in glib >= 0.20.0)
    # glib 0.18.5 is a transitive dependency from Tauri's GTK3 stack:
    #   tauri 2.x → wry → webkit2gtk → gtk 0.18 → glib 0.18.5
    # The entire gtk3-rs ecosystem is UNMAINTAINED (no 0.18.6 backport exists).
    # Cannot upgrade without Tauri migrating to gtk4-rs.
    # Ghost does not use VariantStrIter directly. INFO-level advisory only.
    # Tracking: https://github.com/tauri-apps/webkit2gtk-rs/issues/94
